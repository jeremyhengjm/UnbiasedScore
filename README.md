# UnbiasedScore
This R package provides unbiased estimators for a class of partially observed diffusions. It facilitates parameter inference using stochastic gradient algorithms 
by considering unbiased estimation of the score function, i.e. the gradient of the log-likelihood function for these models. The implementation is based on the arXiv preprint:

[On Unbiased Score Estimation for Partially Observed Diffusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04912).
