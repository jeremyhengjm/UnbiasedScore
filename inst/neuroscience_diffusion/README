- The function hmm_neuroscience_diffusion creates a hidden Markov model for this example. 
- Run demo.R to experiment with various functions for this example.
- The dataset from Hafting et al. (2008) is stored in gridcells.RData.
- Run scripts with filenames starting with "simulate" to generate results that are saved in the results folder. 
- Run scripts with filenames starting with "plot" to create plots of the results.
